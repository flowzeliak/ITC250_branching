Once upon a time...there was a cosplayer in the Emerald City. The cosplayer was heading to the local Comic Con at the Convention Center. The cosplayer was having a difficult time deciding what to wear. The cosplayer chose...

The cosplayer chose to dress as batman. The cosplayer arrived the Comic Con, met people who were wearing superman and wonder woman costumes, everything was good as expected. Suddenly, a middle-aged and well-dressed couple ran toward the cosplayer and shouted "Run, Bruce! Run!" Then they lied on the ground like they were dead. "Well," the cosplayer thought, "I didn't see this coming."
